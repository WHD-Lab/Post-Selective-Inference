# Post-Selective-Inference
Lab repository for post selective inference methods and corresponding code

## Folders:

### Analysis Methods:
Stores code corresponding to the specific methodology. Currently, we only have Basic LASSO.

- #### Basic LASSO\
In this folder, it stores the original copy of code for randomized WCLS with LASSO. There is a folder called "Updated Code"
within this folder, which stores updated or edited code. 

### Data Simulation & Pesudo Outcome
This folder stores function corresponding to data simulation and pesudo-outcome generation.

# Important Todo:
1. remove the dependence on Python code
2. Makes code can handle missing data
3. Adapt code for binary outcomes
